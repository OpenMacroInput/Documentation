> Note: Too Complex to be use. I used it in the past but it is not adequate.


This file is a bit complexe to explain. In resume it allow you to make a regex based on the apparition of boolean that your observe. 
Example: 
```
A↓.*B↑.*A↑♦NewToOld♦1000♦A B C D♦debuglog hello
```

If button A was pressed and button B was released between in the last 1000 second could you send hello to the debug window.
