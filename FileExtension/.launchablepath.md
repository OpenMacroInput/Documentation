# .launchablepath

Launchable path allows you to register some path that you want to be able to execute at some point.  

for example the command:  
- `exe:chromeprivate` will launch chome with the argument `incognito` mode  
- `exe:Hello` will launch the Hello world python script as a python to execute in a display console  
- `exe:map` will launch the Hello world python script as a python to execute  

The code try to check if it is a `.py .ahk .exe .bat` and try to execute the good programme.  
If the extension is unknown, it will be call in a `start "" "YOURPATH" [YOUR ARGUMENT]`  
_If you use py or ahk, be sure to install python or auto hot key and to add the path of the program in the system._   

```
chrome♦C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
chromeprivate♦C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe♦--incognito
startupmenu♦C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
ffmpeg♦C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe
HelloWorld♦C:\Users\OpenMacroInput\Desktop\OMI Come On\JOMI\2020_04_10_JavaOpenMacroInputRuntime\HelloWorld.py
C:\Users\OpenMacroInput\Desktop\Map.jpg
```

Not that it also work with window shortcut linke `.url` and `.lnk`
If you want to make easy changeable shortcut to a path.
Like:
```
ageofempire♦Age of Empire.lnk
//Then in Age of empire short cut put the path of the computer game
//Target "C:\Users\OpenMacroInput\Games\AgeOfEmpireIV.exe"
```

Note that by default, all .python, .bat and .lnk in the folder Configuration of the projet are added to the list of launchable path.

In this case, it is equal to doing this

filename.launchablepath
```
Test.py♦C:\...\Test.py
Autodesk Fusion 360♦C:\...\Autodesk Fusion 360.lnk
Test.bat♦C:\...\Autodesk Fusion 360.bat
Build-Short♦C:\...\Build-Short

```


If you want to execute a python scrip in silence mode behind your game us this command:  
- `exe:hide:Hello.py`  
- `exe:h:Hello.`
