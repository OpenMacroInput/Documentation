# .omi.xml

Omi XML is a file where you can write plenty of XML short block to configure your game instead of using files with extension name.
It helps when you want to not split your configuration everywhere and keep them in a clean file.

This main problem of XML is that when you don't respect the grammar of the file it breaks.


Example of XML OMI Configuration:  
``` xml

<omixml>
    <midiconnectionin midiName="Arduino Micro" />
    <midiconnectionin midiName="MPK mini play" />
    <midiconnectionout midiName="Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth" />  
    <analogdigitalcompressioncom comIdName="COM20" nomenclatureName="FootPattern" />
</omixml>
```
