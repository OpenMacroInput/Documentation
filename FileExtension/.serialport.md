# .serialport

This extension help to create a connection with the serial port of the computer.  
You can write message to a port without having to lost performance.   
But when you read the port, you must create a thread that wait for the message.   

```alias♦serialport♦baudrate♦databits♦parity♦stopbits```  
- alias is the name you want to call the channel when use in your command line  
- serialport is the id of the serial port COM11 for example  
- baudrate, databits, parity, stop bits are classic serialport  
- if `☗In` or  `☗Read` is the line it is considering that you want a thread that listen to the port   


The idea here is that you can have several type of input to read from.  
Some time you just want to received `line` and `shortcut` commands to interpt.  
But most of the time you want to have a translator in front.  

For example:  
- `D01101A21151` on my Digital and Analog standard allows to receive the state of pin  
- `0` `1` on a bike wheel detector can be the frequence of a wheel meaning you need a lua or python script to translate.  

If you don't have a redirection channel to send the message to.  
You can write `☗In♦CommandFromUSB♦Default` that is equals to `☗In♦CommandFromUSB`  
Meaning that every line received will be send to the interpretor.  




``` 
☗In♦NanoAsInput♦DigitalAnalogInput
☗In♦CommandFromUSB♦Default
```


Example of two serial ports to write and the use of a Nano Arduino to read of:
```
//alias♦serialport♦baudrate♦databits♦parity♦stopbits
Xbox1♦COM10♦9600♦8♦None♦One
Xbox2♦COM11♦9600♦8♦None♦One 
CommandFromUSB♦COM12♦9600♦8♦None♦One
NanoAsInput♦COM13♦9600♦8♦None♦One
☗In♦NanoAsInput♦DigitalAnalogInput
☗In♦CommandFromUSB♦Default
```
