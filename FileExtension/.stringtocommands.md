
The quick idea.

You want instead of having long instruction every where to have some macro to call in a simple text.

For example: 

`jomi: enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[HelloG Guy. Ready to rock :) ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑ ⏰40`
This line:   
1. Type enter and wait the game to display the chat  
2. Write a text to send to the chat  
3. Close the chat.  

in a `.stringtocommands` you want to store it as chat:helloguys so you write

`chat.stringtocommands`  
```
chat:helloguys♦jomi: enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[HelloG Guy. Ready to rock :) ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑ ⏰40

```

Now if you want to say that your want to play on the top of the map at every game after saying hello.

`chat.stringtocommands`  
```
chat:helloguys♦jomi: enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[HelloG Guy. Ready to rock :) ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑ ⏰40 ♦ jomi:⏰1200 enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[Can I play top ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑

```

Now you just need to call macro:chat:helloguys anywhere in application and it will execute those commands.

If you don't want a long line you could also write it like that:
`chat.stringtocommands`  
```
chat:hellotop♦macro:chat:helloguys♦macro:lolchat:wanttop
chat:helloguys♦jomi: enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[HelloG Guy. Ready to rock :) ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑ ⏰40 
lolchat:wanttop♦ jomi:⏰1200 enter↓ ⏰400 enter↑ ⏰40 [[Can I play top ?]] ⏰40 enter↓  enter↑

```
